          <a class="u-active-none u-border-none u-btn u-button-link u-button-style u-hover-none u-none u-text-body-color u-btn-1" > In late 2022, the American Diabetes Association (ADA) made a shocking announcement... <br>
            <br>The ADA's committee of experts <span style="font-weight: 700;">removed Metformin</span> from its "first-line" treatments. <br>
            <br>In fact, the ADA now ranks Metformin as inferior to other options for blood sugar control. <br>
            <br>Even so, Big Pharma will NEVER confess that Metformin has been "downgraded"... <br>
            <br>And they'll certainly never reveal <span style="font-weight: 700; text-decoration: underline !important;">this one special food that lowers your A1C</span> while helping you lose weight at the same time. <br>
            <br>Why? Because the US National Library of Medicine says <span style="font-weight: 700;">this food is better than Metformin</span> for folks with blood sugar issues. <br>
